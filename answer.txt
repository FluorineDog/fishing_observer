NOTE: when there is a new ban, the observer must be the sum

round 0 observer 0, generate new ban with ratio of {b, c} is {(1, 1)}
round 0 observer 1, generate new ban with ratio of {c, a} is {(1, 2), (1, 1)}
round 0 observer 2, generate new ban with ratio of {a, b} is {(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1)}
round 1 observer 0, generate new ban with ratio of {b, c} is {(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 5)}
round 1 observer 1, generate new ban with ratio of {c, a} is {(3, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 8), (3, 5)}
round 1 observer 2, generate new ban with ratio of {a, b} is {(2, 7), (3, 2), (8, 3), (1, 3), (4, 7), (8, 13), (4, 5), (3, 1), (5, 2), (1, 4), (4, 3), (3, 4), (2, 5), (4, 1), (5, 8), (3, 5)}
